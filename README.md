# Overview

I found that even I have been developing software for 11 years and even I like it a lot, one thing is to code but not neccessarilly (unfortunately) I know the concept behind. So in my way to be a Senior Developer it's important I know the CONCEPT behind. Maybe I haven´t work on some things but I believe it´s important to to the WHY.

Linkedin assessmnets are a good way what's my level. It has very good assessmnets.
